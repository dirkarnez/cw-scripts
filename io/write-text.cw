- templated file 
  - create new file everytime
  - create + append (like for bookmarking)
  - vscode project settings (cmake, debugger, compiler path, env etc)
    - for c/c++ on vscode, %PATH% should be modified to isolate current compiler from system compiler
  Ôºçvarious (development env setup) script (kind of like system package manager) 
- redirected file (std)
