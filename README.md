cw-scripts
==========
The repository for [Command Wrapper](https://github.com/dirkarnez/cw) scripts.

### Notes
- Best practice `.cw` scripts: fault tolerant (e.g. able to roll back), proper /reasonable pre-execution check (e.g. check if something is installed), returns status for each step.
- should support workplaces - `cw` scripts should declare exact same set of settings to each workplace name(""school", "office", "home, ...")
